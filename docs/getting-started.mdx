# Getting Started

Welcome to your new Docsfly documentation site! This guide will help you understand the basics of creating and organizing your documentation.

## What is Docsfly?

Docsfly is a modern documentation framework built on top of Next.js 15, MDX, and shadcn/ui. It provides a beautiful, fast, and developer-friendly way to create documentation websites.

## Key Features

- **File-based routing**: Your MDX files in the `docs/` directory automatically become routes
- **Beautiful UI**: Built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **Dark mode**: Automatic dark/light mode switching
- **TypeScript support**: Full TypeScript support out of the box
- **Fast performance**: Powered by Next.js 15 and Turbopack

## Creating Your First Page

To create a new documentation page, simply add a new MDX file to the `docs/` directory:

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
description: This is my new documentation page
order: 2
---

# My New Page

This is the content of my new page.
```

## Organizing Your Documentation

You can organize your documentation using:

- **Frontmatter**: Use YAML frontmatter to set title, description, and order
- **Categories**: Group related pages together
- **File structure**: Use folders to create nested navigation
